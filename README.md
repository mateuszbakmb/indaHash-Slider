# indaHash Staff Members Slider

Project created as a first part of a recruitment process at indaHash.

For the most part I tried to recreate provided psd as closely as possible. Didn't go for any flashy animations, decided to keep it tidy and simple.
Probably Either jQuery or Bootstrap could have made my life easier but decided to stick to classic HTML5/CSS3/pure JS +Sass/Scss.
All the JS code is written by myself (that's why it may be a little messy at times, I'm still working on my clean code skills, I'm pretty new to all that).
