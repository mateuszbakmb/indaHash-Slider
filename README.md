# indaHash Staff Members Slider

Project created as a first part of a recruitment process at indaHash.

For the most part I tried to recreate provided psd as closely as possible. Didn't go for any flashy animations, decided to keep it tidy and simple. <br>
Probably Either jQuery or Bootstrap could have made my life easier but decided to stick to classic HTML5/CSS3/pure JS +Sass/Scss.<br>
JS code may be a little messy at times, I'm still working on my clean code skills, I'm pretty new to all that.
